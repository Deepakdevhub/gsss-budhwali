# 🎉 Your Website is LIVE and Working!

## ✅ Everything is Working Perfectly!

Your website is successfully deployed at: **https://gsss-budhwali.vercel.app/**

✅ **Sanity CMS is working** - "Raj" from Sanity is showing on the live site!  
✅ **CORS is configured correctly** - No errors!  
✅ **All 4 schemas are available** in Sanity Studio  

---

## 🔍 Why It Looks "Empty"

The website shows static placeholder content because your Sanity database only has **1 document** (faculty member "Raj").

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ No Government Schemes added yet
- ❌ No Notices added yet
- ❌ No Gallery Images added yet

That's why the console shows: *"No schemes found, using static content"*
